# Tabular Data in the Wild: Gradient Boosting Modeling Improvement
**Policy Planning and Identifying Weakest Links in Texas Public School System Using Public Data**

_Data Science Pipeline developed for the [Identifying Resilience Factors in Texas Public Schools](2022Fall-CHERR-Poster.pdf) project_  by [June Yu](https://j-y-yu.github.io/), (data integration and modeling), [Daniel Payan](https://github.com/danielpayan13) ([dashboard author](https://github.com/DataLab12/resilienceDashboardsTX)), [Li Feng](https://lifeng.wp.txstate.edu/) (domain expert), and [Jelena Tešić](jtesic.github.io) (project lead). The work has been supported by [The Center of Excellence for Community Health and Economic Resilience Research](https://www.cherr.txst.edu/) and [Data Lab](https://DataLab12.github.io) @ Texas State University.

## Data Science Pipeline


## SETUP
  1. Download Anaconda/Juptyer Notebook for your device's operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)
  2. Run Anaconda Prompt app with administrative privileges
     * make sure all the conda packages are up to date: ```conda update --all```

     * install needed packages as follows <TODO>
  3. close the anaconda prompt and open it up as a regular user , type ```>>jupyter notebook```
     * navigate in the browser to this folder and double click on the [JointDashboard.ipynb](JointDashboardh.ipynb) or [District_CountyDashboard.ipynb](District_CountyDashboard.ipynb) to open them (separate windows will open)
     * in separate windows, click `Cell` on the top taskbar and then `Run All`. This will open the the tabbed dashboard.
